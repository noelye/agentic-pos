## 📊 **Comparison Table**

| Service | Free Tier | Setup Time | Monthly Cost | GPU Support |
|---------|-----------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Railway** | $5 credit | 5 minutes | $5-15 | ❌ (CPU only) |
| **Render** | 750 hours | 3 minutes | Free/$7 | ❌ (CPU only) |
| **Google Cloud Run** | Always free tier | 10 minutes | $0.10-2 | ❌ (CPU only) |
| **Heroku** | 1000 hours | 5 minutes | Free/$7 | ❌ (CPU only) |

## 🎯 **Quick Start: Railway (Recommended)**

```bash
# You're already in the right directory
pwd  # Should show: /packages/backend/speech-service

# Deploy to Railway
chmod +x deploy-railway.sh
./deploy-railway.sh
```

After deployment:
1. Get your Railway URL from the dashboard
2. Update your frontend:
   ```bash
   export REACT_APP_SPEECH_SERVICE_URL="wss://your-app.railway.app/ws/transcribe"
   ```

## 🆚 **Alternative: Browser Speech (Immediate Testing)**

While deploying to cloud, you can test **immediately** with browser speech:

```bash
# Start just the frontend
cd ../../..
npm run dev:client
```

The frontend includes **browser speech recognition** that:
- ✅ Works offline
- ✅ No server needed  
- ✅ Good for testing
- ❌ Less accurate than WhisperX

## 🔧 **Which Should You Choose?**

### **For Quick Testing:** Browser Speech API
### **For Production:** Railway.app
### **For Free Hosting:** Render.com  
### **For Scale:** Google Cloud Run
